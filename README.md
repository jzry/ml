# Regression
This part of the project was focused on learning some tools and libraries for basic regressions.

# Classification
I performed binary classification on labeled data and cleaned data to make sure that it works properly.

# Image Classification
I used the Keras library in TensorFlow to classify various examples of labelled images of animals.
